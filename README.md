# InteractiveFramework
Interactive Framework for any custom Automation


base/docs/InteractiveFramework/site/index.html contains a wiki explaining more details.
or use the *help* option in the main menu of interactive.py or main.py


The purpose of the Interactive framework is to onboard and simplify automation scripts.

I am currently working on onboarding the following modules in the future:


**AEM:**
* Package Audit Report
* Package Cleanup
* AEM Node Creation
* Component Report


**SharePoint:**
* User audit
* Site Collection / Subsite Report
* Content Audit

**Active Directory:**
* List Users
* Group Policy Report
* Query Users

**InfoSec**
* Network Scanning / Enumeration
* Common Exploit Lookup


Framework is meant to be modular and dynamic.
